            <p class="home-work-item">
              Table tennis is a game for adults and children, which has won many
              fans around the world. Even if you have never had to pick up a
              racket and play a game of ping-pong, you have probably repeatedly
              become a spectator of gambling sports matches in the yard, on
              summer playgrounds of holiday homes, in parks and even in the
              offices of serious organizations. Simple rules, the availability
              of sports equipment, the absence of the need for serious sports
              training have made table tennis a universal form of physical
              activity. Children like the game, it helps adults distract
              themselves from everyday worries, and promotes socialization of
              representatives of the older generation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ping-pong is played at the table, which is divided into two zones
              by a low net fixed with special fasteners. You will also need
              balls and, of course, a racket to play. We will tell you how to
              choose the right racket for table tennis in this article.
            </p>
            <h3 id="one">The main types of rackets for table tennis</h3>
            <p>
              Before buying a racket for table tennis, we suggest clarifying the
              important criteria for choosing sports equipment for ping-pong.
              The following main types of table tennis rackets are available for
              sale:
            </p>
            <ul class="home-work-list">
              <li class="list-item">
                Ready-made, simple non-disassemble designs, will be an excellent
                choice for amateurs and novice athletes who are taking the first
                steps in table tennis, honing basic techniques. Prices for such
                rackets start from 30-50 hryvnias, but there are also more
                expensive options on sale. Pricing in this segment can be
                influenced by the number of stars (we will talk about them a
                little later), the quality of materials, and the popularity of
                the brand under which sports equipment is produced.
              </li>
              <li>
                Composite rackets are premium segment rackets, which are mainly
                used by professionals and amateurs with a high level of
                training. The structure is assembled from several parts - the
                base, rubbers. Items can be purchased separately and exchanged
                to ensure optimal game performance.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="two">Classification of table tennis rackets by stars</h3>
            <p>
              Earlier we mentioned the "stardom" of ping-pong rackets. What is
              meant by this concept, how to correctly "read" the marking in the
              form of stars, which is applied to the package or directly to the
              inventory?
            </p>
            <p>Classification of table tennis rackets for amateurs:</p>
            <p>«⭐»</p>
            <p>
              The optimal choice for mastering simple basic techniques, for
              amateur competitions between players with a minimum level of
              training. Such inexpensive rackets can be safely bought by
              beginners. If after a few games you lose interest in ping-pong,
              wouldn't it be a pity to spend money on sports equipment.
            </p>
            <p>«⭐⭐» and «⭐⭐⭐»</p>
            <p>
              Rackets with improved characteristics for representatives of the
              amateur level. Such inventory surpasses primitive models with one
              star in terms of its consumer qualities, allows you to advance in
              mastering the basic skills of ping-pong.
            </p>
            <p>«⭐⭐⭐⭐» and «⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐»</p>
            <p>
              Semi-professional rackets, in the production of which modern
              surface treatment technologies and high-quality materials are
              used. Such equipment is suitable for those who have mastered the
              technique perfectly. Among the four- and five-star models, there
              are both ready-made and prefabricated ones.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the large "family" of attributes for the game of ping-pong,
              professional composite rackets stand out, in the design of which
              even the smallest nuances are not neglected. Many models have a
              shifted center of gravity. The cost of such inventory can reach
              several thousand hryvnias. But once again I would like to
              emphasize that such rackets will not make a beginner a ping-pong
              ace. Mastering technique is easier and cheaper with an amateur
              racket.

              Pads, sponges, bases of rackets for table tennis: classification
            </h3>
            <p>
              When choosing a racket for ping-pong, it may seem that all the
              models presented in the sporting goods store are "for one person".
              And, accordingly, the question arises: why such a divergence in
              prices? Several main components can be identified in the design of
              the racket, and the type of material from which they are made can
              affect the cost of the inventory.
            </p>
            <p>
              When choosing a racket for ping-pong, it may seem that all the
              models presented in the sporting goods store are "for one person".
              And, accordingly, the question arises: why such a divergence in
              prices? Several main components can be identified in the design of
              the racket, and the type of material from which they are made can
              affect the cost of the inventory.
            </p>
            <h4 id="four">Basis</h4>
            <p>
              About 85% of the total volume of the racket is the base, for the
              manufacture of which natural wood is used. Sometimes, as an
              alternative to wood, different types of plastic are used.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reinforcing inserts — carbon, fiberglass, cellulose — make it
              possible to improve the consumer qualities of the product. The
              thickness of such a layer usually does not exceed 0.35 mm (up to
              7.5% of the total thickness of the coating).
            </p>
            <p>
              The construction of professional rackets often includes titanium
              plates, 3-5 layers of wood of different species (in some models -
              up to 13 layers!), which are fixed with special glue. When
              connecting the elements of the prefabricated structure, it is
              important to apply glue as evenly as possible, distributing it
              over the surface in a very thin layer.
            </p>
            <h4 id="five">Rubbers</h4>
            <p>
              How to choose pads for table tennis rackets? Why do most athletes
              focus their attention on this component of the structure? The pads
              cover the base from two sides, ensuring the optimal level of
              adhesion of the light ball to the surface. And if in the middle of
              the 20th century, the choice of materials for the manufacture of
              pads, options for the relief of their surface was very limited,
              then today manufacturers of sports equipment spend a lot of time
              and money on the development and testing of rackets with various
              pads.
            </p>
            <p>Types of rackets by type of pads:</p>

            <ul class="list">
              <li class="list-item-second">
                Identical - both surfaces are smooth, so there is no need to
                turn the racket during the game. The characteristics of such
                equipment may differ, and the provision of different speeds of
                the torque depends on this.
              </li>
              <li>
                Different types of construction include smooth and studded pads,
                while one side provides strong rotation, the other - high feed
                speed. To change the tactics of the game, it is enough to turn
                the racket to the desired side. On sale you can find models for
                left-handed and right-handed people.
              </li>
              <li>
                Attackers - are equipped with a smooth pad and an antispin (pad
                with elongated spikes) on the other. By flipping the pad, you
                can make your opponent seriously nervous, make them adapt to
                your chosen game tactics.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h4 id="six">Sponge</h4>
            <p>
              A special spongy layer is placed under the pads, which allows for
              sufficient torque. The thickness of the sponge, depending on the
              type of racket, can be from 1 to 2.5 mm.
            </p>
            <p>
              A thin spongy layer (1-1.7 mm) allows you to control the rotation
              of the ball at low speeds. Sponges with a thickness of 2 mm or
              more are ideal for implementing the attack technique. Rackets with
              intermediate characteristics are a universal solution. Do not
              forget to consider this parameter when choosing a tennis racket
              for table tennis!
            </p>
            <h4 id="seven">The shape of the handle</h4>
            <p>
              Manufacturers of sports equipment offer amateurs and professionals
              ping-pong rackets with handles of the following shape:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Straight - ensure the convenience of turning the racket over.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conical - represent an intermediate option between models with a
                straight handle and a dovetail holder.
              </li>
              <li>
                Flared - not very convenient for turning, changing the grip
                during the game, but they also have their advantages.
              </li>
              <li>
                Concave - an option for experienced players, they provide high
                speed of turns, convenience of changing the grip.
              </li>
              <li>
                Anatomical — for long-term play, for beginners; hands get less
                tired during the game, the inventory feels like an "extension of
                the brush".
